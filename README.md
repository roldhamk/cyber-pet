## Cyber Pet Project

Using JavaScript OOP, I will create a cyber pet with methods that will allow me to do the following: 

* feed my pet 
* give my pet a drink
* play with my pet 
* give my pet exercise
* level up my pet

I will create further methods that will allow me to:

* do an overall stat check
* check if my pet is bored
* check if my pet is hungry or thirsty 
* check if my pet needs exercise
